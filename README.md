# recompose

recompose is a tool for converting [Android layouts in XML](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout)
to Kotlin code using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). It can be used on the command line,
as IntelliJ / Android Studio plugin or as a library in custom code.

## Running

### IntelliJ / Android Studio plugin

The plugin does not get published yet. If you want to try them then you'll have to build them from code. Use the Gradle task `runIde` to run a test IDE with the plugin installed or create an installable plugin with the `buildPlugin` task. The plugin zip will be placed in `recompose-idea/build/distributions/`. To learn how to install it, read the [Install plugin from disk](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#install_plugin_from_disk) section in the IntelliJ docs.

### Command-line interface (CLI)

Like the plugin, the command-line interface does not get published yet. You can run it directly from Gradle via
`./gradlew recompose-cli:run --args="list file paths.."`. Alternatively you can run the `assembleDist` which will place
a zip/tar containing a binary into `recompose-cli/build/distributions/`.

```
Usage: recompose [OPTIONS] INPUT...

Options:
  -o, --output PATH  Output directory for Kotlin code
  -h, --help         Show this message and exit

Arguments:
  INPUT  Layout XML files to convert to Kotlin
```

## Building

Either import the project into [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) on
the command line (via the provided `gradlew` wrapper).

### Modules

* **recompose-ast**: Contains the data classes for the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing a parsed XML layout.
* **recompose-cli**: A command-line interface (CLI) for running recompose in a shell.
* **recompose-composer**: Responsible for taking an AST and transforming it into the equivalent `Composable` Kotlin code.
* **recompose-idea**: An IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio plugin that allows copying XML layouts and pasting as
`Composable` Kotlin code.
* **recompose-test**: Contains test data and helpers for unit tests. 

### Important gradle tasks

* **clean**: Deletes the build directories.
* **test**: Runs all unit tests in all modules.
* **runIde**: Runs IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin installed. 
* **buildPlugin**: Builds the IntelliJ / Android Studio plugin and makes it available in `recompose-idea/build/distributions`.

### How does this work?

The [Parser](https://github.com/pocmo/recompose/blob/main/recompose-parser/src/main/kotlin/recompose/parser/Parser.kt) (`recompose-parser`) takes the input XML and transforms it into an
Abstract Syntax Tree (`recompose-ast`). The [Composer](https://github.com/pocmo/recompose/blob/main/recompose-composer/src/main/kotlin/recompose/composer/Composer.kt) (`recompose-composer`)
takes the AST and translates it into Kotlin code calling [Composables](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/runtime/Composable).

The IntelliJ / Android Studio plugin (`recompose-idea`) uses that to perform the translation when pasting copied XML code. And the CLI (`recompose-cli`) uses it to translate files.

### Can I contribute?

Yes, absolutely. There are a ton of `View`s and attributes to support. The list of issues labeled with [good first issue](https://github.com/pocmo/recompose/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) are a good place to start. An issue from the list labeled with [help wanted](https://github.com/pocmo/recompose/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) may be a good follow-up. Just comment on any issue that interests you.

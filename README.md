# recompose

recompose is a tool for converting [Android layouts in XML](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/declaring-layout)
to Kotlin code using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). It can be used on the command line,
as IntelliJ / Android Studio plugin or as a library in custom code.

## Building

Either import the project into [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or use [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) on
the command line (via the provided `gradlew` wrapper).

### Modules

* **recompose-ast**: Contains the data classes for the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing a parsed XML layout.
* **recompose-cli**: A command-line interface (CLI) for running recompose in a shell.
* **recompose-composer**: Responsible for taking an AST and transforming it into the equivalent `Composable` Kotlin code.
* **recompose-idea**: An IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio plugin that allows copying XML layouts and pasting as
`Composable` Kotlin code.
* **recompose-test**: Contains test data and helpers for unit tests. 

### Important gradle tasks

* **clean**: Deletes the build directories.
* **test**: Runs all unit tests in all modules.
* **runIde**: Runs IntelliJ IDEA with the plugin installed. 
* **buildPlugin**: Builds the IntelliJ / Android Studio plugin and makes it available in `recompose-idea/build/distributions`.
